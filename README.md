# stoopidC

The stoopid programing language rewritten in C

---

## How to Use

You can use the interpreter by running the command `stoopid <filename>`

## Build Instructions

If you dont use g++ change the `CC` variable in `makefile`

Requirements:

- C++ compiler, G++ recommended
- make

NOTE: mingw comes with make, its just named mingw32-make, so if you are using mingw just run `mingw32-make` instead of `make`

### Windows

1. create a folder called `build`
2. `make compile-windows`
3. `make exe`
4. `make del`
5. run `stoopid.exe` in the `build` folder with the script as an argument, for testing use `test.stpd`

### Linux

1. create a folder called `build`
2. `make compile-linux`
3. `make exe`
4. `make rm`
5. run `stoopid` in the `build` folder with the script as an argument, for testing use `test.stpd`

You can also use the provied debug scripts for your Operating System but they are just made for testing
